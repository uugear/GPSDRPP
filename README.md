# GPSDR++ (GPSDRPP)
GPSDR++ is the software for [VU GPSDR](https://www.uugear.com/product/vu-gpsdr/), and it is based on the open-source [SDR++](https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus) project, originally created by Alexandre Rouma (ON5RYZ) and enriched by many talented contributors. We deeply appreciate their dedication and hard work, which form the foundation of this software.
